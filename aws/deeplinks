CloudFront & Custom Domain Troubleshooting Checklist

SSL/TLS Certificate:
 Confirm the certificate includes the desired domain name (e.g., links.simplyfit.ai).
 Verify the certificate's status. It should be 'Issued', not 'Pending' or 'Failed'.
CloudFront Distribution Settings:
 Confirm the custom domain is listed under 'Alternate Domain Names (CNAMEs)' in the CloudFront distribution.
 Verify that the correct ACM certificate (or another provider's certificate) is selected for the distribution.
DNS Propagation:
 Remember that DNS changes might take time to propagate, ranging from a few minutes to 48 hours.
 Use DNS lookup tools or dig command to ensure the CNAME correctly points to the CloudFront distribution.
Copy code
dig your_custom_domain.com
Check if it resolves to your CloudFront distribution URL.
Browser Cache:
 Clear browser cache or try from a different browser/incognito mode. Avoid getting tricked by cached error responses.
SSL/TLS Configuration on CloudFront:
 Check if CloudFront is set to redirect HTTP to HTTPS or to exclusively serve content over HTTPS.
 Confirm the security policy (SSL/TLS version) set on CloudFront is compatible with the clients/browsers being tested.
Reach Out to AWS Support:
 If everything seems in order but issues persist, contact AWS Support. They can provide insights into specific configurations or hidden errors.
Note: Proceed cautiously. Making too many changes rapidly can complicate the debugging process. Debugging step-by-step is often the most effective approach.
